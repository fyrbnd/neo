Library for working with graphs in C. Work in progress.

## goals

* making your life easier if you want to quickly write code that relies on the abstract idea of a graph
* proving to our CS teacher in school that Java is BS

## use

Just #include it. Detailed description of what functions exist and how to use them will be added once the code is mostly done.
