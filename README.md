# neo

Library for working with graphs in C. Work in progress. Most basics are done, but a couple planned functions are missing.

## goals

* making your life easier if you want to quickly write code that relies on the abstract idea of a graph
* proving to our CS teacher in school that Java is BS

## use

No makefile as of now, so:

* download `neo.h` and `neo.c` into the directory of your project
* ```c
  #include "neo.h"
  ```
## bugs

* will probably break on Microsoft Windows due to strange character management on OS level (WONTFIX)

Open an issue if you find something else!
